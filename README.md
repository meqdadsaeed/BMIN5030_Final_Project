# BMIN5030 Final Project
## Direct cost of Glaucoma Treatment and Management by Disease Severity

Overview

Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss worldwide and represents a growing public health issue and economic burden in the United States. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), the most common subtype, is a progressive optic neuropathy that usually remains asymptomatic until significant visual field loss has occurred. And with increasing in the disease severity, the patients require more monitoring, medical and surgical interventions, all of which contribute to rising healthcare costs.

Understanding how costs accumulate across mild, moderate, and severe stages of disease is essential for optimizing the allocation of resources cost-effective care delivery, and the development of personalized management strategies.

This project highlights the direct medical costs associated with POAG management at a single eye center, stratified by disease severity. Through quantifying of costs related to encounter visits, medications, and procedures, this project aims to provide an insight how the costs of this disease evlove between stages as it's progress.
